## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from ChatGPT.

## Methodology
- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming raw HR data using Power Query
- **Analysis Techniques**: Data visualization, trend analysis, segmentation, and DAX calculations
- **Key Metrics**: Attrition rate, department-wise turnover, job role analysis, tenure-based trends

## Power BI Skills Applied
- **Power Query**: Used for data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX Formula for Attrition Rate%**:
  ```DAX
  Attrition Rate% = 
  DIVIDE(
      CALCULATE(
          COUNT('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[EmployeeNumber]),
          'WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[Attrition] = "Yes"
      ),
      COUNT('WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition'[EmployeeNumber])
  )
  ```
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive reports to display insights effectively.
